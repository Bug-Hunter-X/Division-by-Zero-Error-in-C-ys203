This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero scenarios.  The error is a runtime error, meaning it doesn't show up during compilation but instead causes the program to crash during execution if the divisor is zero. The solution is to incorporate error handling techniques to prevent the crash.
